# Phase 3 Project: CLI and ORM

## Learning Goals

- Implement a Python application that includes a **Command Line Interface**.
- Implement a set of **Object-Relational Mapping** functions for two or more
  model classes.
- Define a Python object model that includes a one-to-many relationship between
  two classes.
- Exercise best practices in CLI design.
- Exercise best practices in OOP.

---

## Key Vocab

- **Command Line**: a text-based interface that is built into your computer's
  operating system. It allows you to access the files and applications on your
  computer manually or through scripts.
- **Terminal**: the application in Mac OS that allows you to access the command
  line.
- **Command Shell/Powershell**: the applications in Windows that allow you to
  access the command line.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: a text-based interface used to run programs,
  manage files and interact with objects in memory. As the name suggests, it is
  run from the command line.
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: a programming technique that provides a
  mapping between an object-oriented data model and a relational database model.
- **Attribute**: variables that belong to an object.
- **Property**: attributes that are controlled by methods.
- **Decorator**: function that takes another function as an argument and returns
  a new function with added functionality.

## Introduction

Welcome to the end of Phase 3! You've learned about a lot in this unit:

- Python fundamentals.
- Data structures (and more recently, algorithms).
- Object-oriented programming.
- Object inheritance.
- Instance and class attributes and methods.
- Configuring applications.
- SQL fundamentals.
- Table relations in SQL.
- Object-relational mapping with Python.
- Building CLIs.

You're going to use these skills to create a CLI and ORM application. The Phase
3 project is open-ended when it comes to the actual content. You are free to
create whatever you'd like, as long as it incorporates the requirements listed
below.

## Requirements

You need to implement a Python CLI Application that meets the following
requirements:

- The application must include a database created and modified with Python ORM
  methods that you write.
  - The data model must include **at least 2** model classes.
  - The data model must include **at least 1** one-to-many relationships.
  - Property methods should be defined to add appropriate constraints to each
    model class.
  - Each model class should include ORM methods (create, update, delete, get
    all, and find by id).
- The CLI must display menus with which a user may interact.
- The CLI should use loops as needed to keep the user in the application until
  they choose to exit.
- For each class in the data model, the CLI must include options to create,
  update, delete, get all, and find by id.
- The CLI should provide informative feedback to the user.
- The project code should follow OOP best practices.
- The project should use a well-maintained virtual environment using Pipenv.
- Project folders, files, and modules should be organized and follow appropriate
  naming conventions.
- The project should include a `README.md` file that describes the application.

You do **not** need to implement tests for `pytest`, although you should test
your code thoroughly using your CLI. Try entering bad data when prompted for
input, and confirm your application prints a useful error message.

## How to begin?

- Start with the project template (provided in the following lesson). You are
  free to adapt the template structure, as long as you adhere to the project
  requirements.
- Think about the user interaction. How will you prompt the user? What
  information will the user enter? How will you provide feedback to the user?
- Think about your data model. How will you organize and store the information
  received from the user?
- If you get stuck trying to accomplish a specific task, check online to see if
  there's a Python library that will make it easier.
- Consider using [Click][click] or [Fire][fire] to take care of basic CLI tasks
  for you.
